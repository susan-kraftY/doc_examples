# SBSEG Commercial Technology (Com/Tech) Library Project Summary

## Context
This research project aims to design a documentation portal for SBSEG Sales and Marketing to better understand Com/Tech operations.

## Customer Problem
Sales and Marketing face issues with communication and understanding Com/Tech's role and capabilities, leading to a sense of disconnection. Key pain points include:
- Unclear how to ask for help
- Lack of knowledge about Com/Tech capabilities and updates
- Plans based on assumptions, not facts

## Solution and Goals
Create a Com/Tech information knowledge base for Sales and Marketing to improve visibility into Com/Tech operations. This platform will facilitate clear communication and provide relevant content without dictating Com/Tech's internal processes.

### Content
The knowledge base will include:
- Purpose, organization, vision, and goals of each Com/Tech group
- Release notes, videos, user guides, and other informative files focused on Sales and Marketing
- Processes, release rhythms, and roadmaps

### Platform Requirements
The platform must be:
- Searchable, durable, and taggable
- Accurate and capable of delivering content seamlessly
- Updated regularly with notifications to document owners
- Able to handle communications of completed work

## Progress Report
Initial content and platform criteria were defined and tested with the Campaign Manager. Key inquiries include:
- Assessing current shared information to inform the knowledge base architecture
- Providing a platform for release notes, videos, and user guides
- Designing a content population process
- Reviewing the CM GitHub web page for design and content delivery

## Next Steps
Identify and define requirements to tailor the platform and file structure for Marketing and Sales. The initial proposal includes:
- Content architecture with a platform capabilities matrix
- Platform governance and evaluation
